help: Allow EAP-Success/EAP-Failure without going through an
                authentication step. Some switches use such a sequence when
                forcing the port to be authorized/unauthorized or as a fallback
                option if the authentication server is unreachable. This is
                disabled by default to protect against potential attacks by
                rogue devices.
